Here are my favorite monkey type themes. 

## <ins>Mexican</ins>

I love this theme because of the bright colors and the contrast between purple and orange. The vibrant colors create a beautiful layout that I really like. I would reccommend this theme if you don't mind vibrant and bright colors.



## <ins>Strawberry</ins>

This theme is pretty nice because of the calm pink colors. They don't create too much eyestrain after looking at it for a long time either. The colors are in different shades of pink that contrast between eachother just enough for you to easily see what your typing. People who like pink or like pastel colors should use this.



## <ins>Fire</ins>

The blue, red and orange while typing really stands out but looks kind of weird too. In my opinion I think this theme is really good if you want something new for a change, but I wouldn't use it permanently.
